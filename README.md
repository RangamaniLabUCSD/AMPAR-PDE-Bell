# AMPAR-PDE
COMSOL files for AMPAR PDE work by Bell et al.
Thin and mushroom spines of different volumes use the same COMSOL format of 2D axisymmetric simulations.
Realistic spines are 3D simulations. Due to file size restrictions, they cannot be included here. 
Please contact the corresponding author for those files.
